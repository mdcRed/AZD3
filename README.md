# AZD3

AZD3 is a library of Arizona maps at different levels of granularity. AZD3 maps are built with the D3.js library by Mike Bostock, which uses HTML, SVG and CSS to create interactive data visualizations. AZD3 provides a framework for quickly visualizing Arizona statewide, county, city, and neighborhood data. 

For more on core D3.js [Check out Mike Bostock's repo.](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)

AZD3 maps are built on the framework provided in Scott Murray's fantastic D3 Book examples, [see the code](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book).
